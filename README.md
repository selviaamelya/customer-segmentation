# Customer Segmentation for Office Supplies Vendor Sales
An office supplies vendor called Superstore aims to offer promotions to its customers, requiring a detailed data analysis. The RFM analysis segments customers based on recency, frequency of transactions, and monetary value. Customer segmentation classifies them into three groups: silver customers, gold customers, and platinum customers.
- Platinum customers are those who shop frequently and spend a significant amount of money.
- Silver customers are those who shop infrequently and spend a small amount of money.
- Gold customers are those who fall between silver and platinum customers.

This segmentation helps determine the level of promotions each group will receive, ranging from large, moderate, to small.
